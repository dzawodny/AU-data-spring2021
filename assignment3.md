# Time to go back to school in Maryland...but should it be? #

In a recent press conference, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan requested that all Maryland school districts that are not currently offering any form of in-person learning do so by March 1. As a result, many large school systems that have been totally virtual like Baltimore City, Baltimore County and Howard County plan to begin a hybrid instruction model in the coming weeks.

According to one teacher I know who works in Baltimore County, many schools in the system are sending questionaires home to parents to ask if they would be willing to send their kids to in-person classes. She said that schools are getting overwhelmingly high responses saying no. If that data were to be compiled and made public, would it in any way affect whether or not school systems do in fact move to in-person classes before the end of this school year or overall reopening plans?

In an ideal world where schools share this sort of stuff when I call them, the data might look like this:

School name | County | Grades serviced | Number of students | number of responses to questionaire | # yes willing to return March 1 | # no not willing 
------------|--------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------
Eastern Technical High School | Baltimore County | 9-12 
Riderwood Elementary School | Baltimore County | K-5
Ridgely Middle School | Baltimore County | 6-8
City College High School | Baltimore City | 9-12
