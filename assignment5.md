## Questions ##

In examining Baltimore arrest records from 2014 to 2020 as well as a data set from the Gun Offender Registry, I'll look for answers to the following questions:

1. Does the demographic makeup of people arrested in Baltimore reflect the demographic makeup of city residents as a whole according to the Census?

**According to U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts online, 62.4% of Baltimore residents identify as black and 27.5% identify as white with no Hispanic/Latino origin. These numbers differ greatly from arrest data. Between 2014 and 2020, 83.9% of arrests made were of people identified as black, and 15.6% were of people identified as white.**

2. Is there a discrepancy between the demographic makeup of firearms related arrests vs. all other arrests?

**Yes. The discrepancy from the Census data is even larger in this category, with 95.22% of people arrested for gun related crimes in Baltimore being black, and only 3.89% of people arrested for gun related crimes being white.**

3. Are the same numbers reflected in the dataset for the Gun Offender Registry?

**It's close, but is skewed even more. 96.53% of registered gun offenders in Baltimore are black, whereas only 2.74% are white. Also of statistical significance is that of that 2.74% of white gun offenders, 20.27% of entries are missing any address information (half the point of the dataset). For black registrants, only 6.77% are missing address information.**


## Racial disparities in arrest records suggest Baltimore Police keep better tabs on black gun offenders ##

A 2007 law requires any person convicted of a gun-related crime to register their name and address with the Baltimore Police Department and conduct check-ins with authorities every six months for three years. On the registry itself, available through Baltimore Open Data, BPD lacks updated information for 20.3% of white offenders compared to just 6.8% of black offenders. A mere 2.7%, or 74 registrants, of those on the list identify as white, compared to 96.5%, or 2,614, who are black. Now years removed from the 2017 Federal Consent Decree between BPD and the U.S. Department of Justice that promised an end to discriminatory policing in the city, local advocates are urging more changes.
