## Questions ##

In examining Baltimore arrest records from 2014 to 2020 as well as a data set from the Gun Offender Registry, I'll look for answers to the following questions:

1. Does the demographic makeup of people arrested in Baltimore reflect the demographic makeup of city residents as a whole according to the Census?
2. Is there a discrepancy between the demographic makeup of firearms related arrests vs. all other arrests?
3. Are the same numbers reflected in the dataset for the Gun Offender Registry?
