# D.C. Landlords and Evictions - What's out there #

Using data available through OpenDataDC, we will examine how property ownership in the district has shifted since the financial crisis that began in 2008. More specifically, we will tease out and compare the numbers of residential units owned and rented by landlords to look for shifts over time â€” has the rental market predominantly shifted into the hands of corporations and wealthier owners, or are there still just as many "mom and pop" landlords that rent out a place or two on Craigslist?

Further, we will compare any shift we find with eviction data from the district to shed light on what this all may mean with the impending end to the eviction moratorium.

## Reporting we found ##

**Evictions in the District**

+ [Washington City Paper](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/500983/these-landlords-file-the-most-evictions-in-d-c/) reported in October that 10 landlords who own 16% of rental properties in the District filed 37% of evictions between 2014 and 2019.
+ [DCist](https://dcist.com/story/20/12/16/judge-strikes-down-dc-ban-eviction-filings/) reported in December that a D.C. Superior Court Judge ruled that a ban on eviction filings during the pandemic was unconstitutional.
+ [Street Sense Media](https://www.streetsensemedia.org/article/seal-tenant-eviction-records-limit-landlord-filing/#.YBNh0ehKhPY) reported in October that D.C. City Council passed a bill to change some of the rules regarding evictions to the benefit of renters. The new law restricts landlords from discriminating against renters with a prior eviction on record and mandates the sealing of eviction records after 30 days if the eviction is not carried out and three years if it is.
