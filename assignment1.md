# Assignment 1 - Critique of Tampa Bay Times Investigation of Police Practices / Final Story Pitch

[Targeted - A Tampa Bay Times Investigation](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2020/investigations/police-pasco-sheriff-targeted/intelligence-led-policing/)

*All ratings are based on a 1-5 scale, with 1 indicating a low rating and 5 indicating a rating of excellent*

## Clarity and Accuracy ##

The central insight of this investigation is that Pasco County Police have created an intelligence program that effectively allows police to harass residents without cause in the name of preventing crime. The investigation gets a rating of **4**, as the lede quickly communicates this finding over the course of the first few short graphs. The snappy headline - Targeted - encapsulates this idea and the subheading gives the reader more of the meat of the story. 

The investigation did not provide any data visualization. This is disappointing as it could have packed more of a punch into the story. However, at the end, there is a description of how the Times conducted their reporting, obtained data and gleaned information from it. This also sheds some light on potential reasons to hide data they had obtained as it was predominantly the personal information of minors. The process appears extensive and gives no reason to doubt its accuracy, but as it did not provide any links to and/or visualizations of the police data they obtained, the data accuracy cannot receive a 5. 

## Quality ##

The piece gets a rating of **4.5** for overall quality. The reporters cover the story from both the perspectives of the police and the victims of police harrassment, doing so objectively. Further, the piece beautifully ties together personal testimony and narrative with a larger context. If the data had been presented visually, it could have received a full 5. 

## Type and Color ##

### Type ###

An easy **5**. The typefaces are clear, easy to read, and change based on what part of the piece it hightlights — be it main text, a headline or photo caption — making it easy for the reader to navigate the story elements. The piece is organized well and free of unneccesary frills.

### Color ###

**N/A** - Color is used to convey emotion and intensity within the photographs, but not used to help visualize data or otherwise move the story forward.

## Creativity ##

The piece's use of photography and visual storytelling is exceptional. Photographing the victims of police harrassment in front of their houses just screams "get off my lawn" and communicates the violation of intimacy of the home where the harrassment often occurred. Personal family photos often completemented these portraits to add more touches of humanity. The piece also used screen grabs from officer body camera footage to show the victims in the moments of police encounters. Overall, a **5** in this category.

# Story Pitch #

*Could prioritizing the undocumented immigrant community across the U.S. for COVID-19 vaccination end our country's Coronavirus crisis sooner?*

Let's start with the most poignant data set available - COVIV-19 positivity rate. Johns Hopkins Hospital has partnered with community organizations in Baltimore to offer no-cost testing at an East Baltimore church attended predominantly by immigrants, many of whom are undocumented. The positivity rate at this site often towers above the overall rate for the city, at one point getting as high as **48%**.

Beyond that, we could think of creative ways to get numbers that show roughly how many frontline/essential jobs like food production and processing, sanitation and more are occupied by undocumented workers. 

This story is timely as we are currently in the throws of vaccination rollout and having nationwide conversations about how to weild vaccines to most quickly end the pandemic. For this story, we could interview undocumented workers, immigrant rights advocates, infectious disease experts and healthcare providers who work with immigrant populations.
